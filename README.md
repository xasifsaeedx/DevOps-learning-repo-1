Comment 1:

This is a repo that is created to learn Github, remote repos, how to push and pull the code. With time, I will add more information and achievements to Readme file to help keep track of my learning. I will be working only with GIT and using GitHub as a remote repo. This will help me learn the OPS side of the Git and how to use repos in a real world environment.
